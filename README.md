# BlocksFromExcel - sample code - use at own risk

Reads blockname and attribute property from an Excel sheet and places blocks accordingly by name and displays the attribute using the property from Excel.

The blocks need to exist in the drawing already, even if not visible (e.g. using a template drawing that contains all these blocks).

The test block (name: "asdf") needs to contain an attribute called "FDSA", which is visible.
